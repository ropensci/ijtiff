## Introduction

This is a general purpose TIFF I/O utility for R. The [`tiff`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tiff) already exists for
this purpose but `ijtiff` adds some functionality and overcomes some
bugs therein.

- `ijtiff` can write TIFF files whose pixel values are real
  (floating-point) numbers; `tiff` cannot.
- `ijtiff` can read and write *text images*; `tiff` cannot.
- `tiff` struggles to interpret channel information and gives cryptic
  errors when reading TIFF files written by the *ImageJ* software;
  `ijtiff` works smoothly with these images.

To learn about `ijtiff` and how to use it, visit the package website at
<https://docs.ropensci.org/ijtiff/>.
