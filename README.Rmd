## Introduction

This is a general purpose TIFF I/O utility for R. The [`tiff` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tiff) already exists for this purpose but `ijtiff` adds some functionality and overcomes some bugs therein. 

* `ijtiff` can write TIFF files whose pixel values are real (floating-point) numbers; `tiff` cannot. 
* `ijtiff` can read and write _text images_; `tiff` cannot.
* `tiff` struggles to interpret channel information and gives cryptic errors when reading TIFF files written by the _ImageJ_ software; `ijtiff` works smoothly with these images.

To learn about `ijtiff` and how to use it, visit the package website at https://docs.ropensci.org/ijtiff/.


## Installation

### `libtiff`

`ijtiff` requires you to have the `libtiff` C library installed. To install `libtiff`:

* On __Debian Linux__, try `sudo apt-get install libtiff-dev libbz2-dev libdeflate-dev liblzma-dev libwebp-dev libzstd-dev zlib1g-dev`.
* On __Fedora Linux__, try `sudo yum install libtiff-devel libbz2-devel libdeflate-devel liblzma-devel libwebp-devel libzstd-devel zlib-devel`.
* On __Mac__, you need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Then in the terminal, run `brew install libtiff`.
* On __Windows__, no setup is required.


### Installing the release version of the `ijtiff` R package

You can install `ijtiff` from CRAN (recommended) with:
```{r CRAN-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ijtiff")
```


### Installing the development version of the `ijtiff` R package

You can install the development version from GitHub with:
```{r GitHub-installation, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/ijtiff")
```
