# `ijtiff` 2.2.7

# BUG FIXES
* Fix for new libtiff using C99's `<stdint.h>`.


# `ijtiff` 2.2.6

# BUG FIXES
* Suppress unhelpful warnings during configure when `pkg-config` doesn't find info for libtiff.
* Remove `LazyData` from `DESCRIPTION` (was causing CRAN note).


# `ijtiff` 2.2.5

## BUG FIXES
* Typo fix for `configure`. At one point there was a call of `pkg-configs` instead of `pkg-config`.
* Also now all compile flags from `pkg-config --libs` _and_ `pkg-config --libs --static` are used every time.


# `ijtiff` 2.2.4

## BUG FIXES
* Fix for `configure` error messages.


# `ijtiff` 2.2.3

## BUG FIXES
* Make `configure` more portable by using `sh` instead of `bash`.


# `ijtiff` 2.2.2

## BUG FIXES
* Insist on bug-fixed `strex` >= 1.4.


# `ijtiff` 2.2.1

## BUG FIXES
* Insist on `strex` >= 1.3.1 to avoid a garbage collection issue.


# `ijtiff` 2.2.0

## NEW FEATURES 
* The package now works on 32-bit Windows (thanks to PR #12 from Jeroen Ooms).

## BUG FIXES
* Fix tests by making use of `testthat::test_path()`.


# `ijtiff` 2.1.2

## BUG FIXES
* Fix some typos in the vignettes.


# `ijtiff` 2.1.1

## BUG FIXES
* Fix a PROTECTion error.


# `ijtiff` 2.1.0

## NEW FEATURES
* Add support for images with colormaps (also known as lookup tables (LUTs)).
* Add a print method for `ijtiff_img`s.


# `ijtiff` 2.0.5

## BUG FIXES
* Fix a test that failed due to breaking changes in `tibble`.


# `ijtiff` 2.0.4

## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Include rOpenSci docs in `DESCRIPTION` as `URL`.

## BUG FIXES
* Sometimes `pkg-config` declares that `ijtiff` needs JBIG_KIT (compile flag `-ljbig`) at compile time. This is incorrect and it often causes users installation pain. This fix is a hack that removes this compile flag from the `pkg-config` output.


# `ijtiff` 2.0.3

## BUG FIXES
* `libjpeg` needs to be in `SystemRequirements`.


# `ijtiff` 2.0.2

## BUG FIXES
* For _ImageJ_-written images, if `n_slices` and `n_frames` are both specified, that should be OK if they're equal.


# `ijtiff` 2.0.1

## BUG FIXES
* Insist on latest, bug-fixed `filesstrings` 3.1.5.


# `ijtiff` 2.0.0

## BREAKING CHANGES
* `get_tiff_tags_reference()` is now `tif_tags_reference()`.
* `count_imgs()` is now `count_frames()`.

## NEW FEATURES
* It is now possible to read only certain frames of a TIFF image thanks to the `frames` argument of `read_tif()`.
* `read_tif()` and `read_tags()` now have the aliases `tif_read()` and `tags_read()` to comply with the rOpenSci `object_verb()` style.

## BUG FIXES
* Include `sys/types.h` for greater type compatibility.


# `ijtiff` 1.5.1

## BUG FIXES
* Require necessary version of `glue`.
* Fix dimension-related bug in `as_EBImage()`.
* Require latest (less-buggy) `filesstrings`.


# `ijtiff` 1.5.0

## NEW FEATURES
* Allow ZIP compression (which seems to be the best).

## BUG FIXES
* `write_txt_img()` was using decimal points for integers (e.g. 3.000 instead of just 3).


# `ijtiff` 1.4.2

## BUG FIXES
* Hacky fix for `configure` script to deal with lack of `-ljbig` on Solaris.
* Trim the package to below 5MB by compressing a few TIFF files.


# `ijtiff` 1.4.1

## NEW FEATURES
* The package is now lighter in appearance because it doesn't explicitly depend on `tibble`.

## BUG FIXES
* The configure script now allows for needing `--static` with `pkg-config`.

* A `pkgdown` website.

## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Better vignettes.
* Better error messages.


# `ijtiff` 1.3.0

# `ijtiff` 1.2.0

## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Improved the description of the package in DESCRIPTION, vignette and README.
* Added a hex sticker.
* Limited support for tiled images thanks to new author Kent Johnson.
* `write_tif()` is now slightly (<10%) faster.
* `write_tif()` messages are now more informative.


# `ijtiff` 1.1.0 

## NEW FEATURES
* `count_imgs()` counts the number of images in a TIFF file without reading the images themselves.
* `read_tags()` reads the tags from TIFF images without reading the images themselves.

## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Now includes citation information.
* C code is more readable.
* `display()` is more flexible, accepting 3 and 4-dimensional arrays, just displaying the first frame from the first channel.


## `ijtiff` 1.0.0

#### PEER REVIEW
* The package is now peer reviewed by ROpenSci.


## `ijtiff` 0.3.0

#### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Improve README and vignette with more tangible and fun example.

#### BUG FIXES
* Fix windows `libtiff` issues (thanks to Jeroen Ooms).
